Thank you for your input!

Note, we try to not clutter the bug tracker with wishlist items and ideas.
Often it's best to raise these first on the #hledger IRC chat room or the mail list:

http://irc.hledger.org   (quickest; no chat client needed)
http://list.hledger.org  (most eyeballs)

to discuss solutions and attract interest. Use your best judgement.
