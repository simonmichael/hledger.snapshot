hledger (http://hledger.org) is a dependable, precise, cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple plain text file format.  It is a haskell reimplementation of Ledger, provides command-line, curses and web interfaces, and aims to be a robust, practical tool for daily use.

In double-entry accounting, each transaction must be balanced: An equal amount added to one account must be subtracted from another. You may wish to consult hledger documentation or other tutorials on the web to learn how to use double-entry accounting.

Sandstorm users, thanks for your feedback. hledger's web UI is a simple one to fit current development resources, and I'm sorry that Sandstorm integration is lacking. Your help is needed. We have an open issue for this where you can add a bounty or contribute patches (https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/425). We also welcome bug reports with more detail (http://bugs.hledger.org/new), general hledger-web improvements, backers and sponsors (http://hledger.org).
