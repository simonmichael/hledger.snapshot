hledger is a (primarily) command-line accounting tool similar to John
Wiegley's "ledger".  It reads a plain text journal file describing money
or commodity transactions, or timelog entries, and generates precise
activity and balance reports.

Since the last report, hledger has reached release 0.4 on Hackage. It has
60 test cases, new features such as basic curses and web-based interfaces,
and has had some performance tuning. It is now quite useful for day to day
reporting of money and time. Also, the project has a new web address
(hledger.org), and has attracted two new committers.
