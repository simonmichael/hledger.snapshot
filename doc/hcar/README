Dear all,

We would like to collect contributions for the 28th edition of the

============================================================
             Haskell Communities & Activities Report

http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Communities_and_Activities_Report

                Submission deadline: 30 October 2015

     (please send your contributions to hcar at haskell.org,
                 in plain text or LaTeX format, both are equally accepted)
============================================================

This is the short story:

* If you are working on any project that is in some way related
  to Haskell, please write a short entry and submit it. Even if
  the project is very small or unfinished or you think it is not
  important enough --- please reconsider and submit an entry anyway!

* If you are interested in an existing project related to Haskell that
  has not previously been mentioned in the HCAR, please tell us, so
  that we can contact the project leaders and ask them to submit an
  entry.

* If you are working on a project that is looking for contributors,
  please write a short entry and submit it, mentioning that your are looking
  for contributors. The final report might have an index with such projects,
  provided we get enough such submissions.

* Feel free to pass on this call for contributions to others that
  might be interested.

More detailed information:

The Haskell Communities & Activities Report is a bi-annual overview of
the state of Haskell as well as Haskell-related projects over the
last, and possibly the upcoming six months. If you have only recently
been exposed to Haskell, it might be a good idea to browse the
previous edition --- you will find interesting projects described as
well as several starting points and links that may provide answers to
many questions.

Contributions will be collected until the submission deadline. They
will then be compiled into a coherent report that is published online
as soon as it is ready. As always, this is a great opportunity to
update your webpages, make new releases, announce or even start new
projects, or to talk about developments you want every Haskeller to
know about!

Looking forward to your contributions,

Mihai Maruseac and Alejandro Serrano Mena


FAQ:

Q: What format should I write in?

A: The usual format is a LaTeX source file, adhering to the template
that is available at:

     http://haskell.org/communities/05-2015/template.tex

There is also a LaTeX style file at

     http://haskell.org/communities/05-2015/hcar.sty

that you can use to preview your entry. If you do not know LaTeX, then
use plain text. If you modify an old entry that you have written for an
earlier edition of the report, you should soon receive your old entry as
a template (provided we have your valid email address). Please modify
that template, rather than using your own version of the old entry as a
template.

_However_, if you don't want/have time to format the entry for LaTeX,
you can submit it in any other format possible and we will be happy to
convert it for the final report.

Q: Can I include Haskell code?

A: Yes. Please use lhs2tex syntax (http://www.andres-loeh.de/lhs2tex/).
The report is compiled in mode polycode.fmt.

Q: Can I include images?

A: Yes, you are even encouraged to do so. Please use .jpg or .png
format, then, PNG being preferred for simplicity.

Q: Should I send files in .zip archives or similar?

A: No, plain file attachements are the way.

Q: How much should I write?

A: Authors are asked to limit entries to about one column of text. A
general introduction is helpful. Apart from that, you should focus on
recent or upcoming developments. Pointers to online content can be given
for more comprehensive or "historic" overviews of a project. Images do
not count towards the length limit, so you may want to use this
opportunity to pep up entries. There is no minimum length of an entry!
The report aims for being as complete as possible, so please consider
writing an entry, even if it is only a few lines long.

Q: Which topics are relevant?

A: All topics which are related to Haskell in some way are relevant. We
usually had reports from users of Haskell (private, academic, or
commercial), from authors or contributors to projects related to
Haskell, from people working on the Haskell language, libraries, on
language extensions or variants. We also like reports about
distributions of Haskell software, Haskell infrastructure, books and
tutorials on Haskell. Reports on past and upcoming events related to
Haskell are also relevant. Finally, there might be new topics we do not
even think about. As a rule of thumb: if in doubt, then it probably is
relevant and has a place in the HCAR. You can also simply ask us.

Q: Is unfinished work relevant? Are ideas for projects relevant?

A: Yes! You can use the HCAR to talk about projects you are currently
working on. You can use it to look for other developers that might help
you. You can use HCAR to ask for more contributors to your project,
it is a good way to gain visibility and traction.

Q: If I do not update my entry, but want to keep it in the report, what
should I do?

A: Tell us that there are no changes. The old entry will typically be
reused in this case, but it might be dropped if it is older than a year,
to give more room and more attention to projects that change a lot. Do
not resend complete entries if you have not changed them.

Q: Will I get confirmation if I send an entry? How do I know whether my
email has even reached its destination, and not ended up in a spam folder?

A: Prior to publication of the final report, we will send a draft to all
contributors, for possible corrections. So if you do not hear from us
within two weeks after the deadline, it is safer to send another mail
and check whether your first one was received.
