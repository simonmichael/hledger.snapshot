# name the csv fields, and assign some of them as journal entry fields
fields  date, description, amount-out, amount-in, balance
# Note: we generate balance assertions from the balance field here,
# but you may sometimes need to remove these because:
# - the CSV balance differs from the true balance, 
#   by up to 0.0000000000005 in my experience
# - it is sometimes calculated based on non-chronological ordering,
#   eg when multiple transactions clear on the same day

# date is in UK/Ireland format
date-format  %d/%m/%Y

# set the currency
currency  EUR

# set the base account for all txns
account1  assets:personal:bank:bank of ireland:checking

# an alternative to using amount-in & amount-out:
# use the (sign-flipped) third field by default, or if it's empty, the fourth
# amount  -%3
# if ^[^,]*,[^,]*,,
#  amount  %4
