test
Run built-in unit tests.

_FLAGS_

This command runs the unit tests built in to hledger-lib and hledger,
printing test names and results on stdout. If any test fails, the exit
code will be non-zero.

Test names include a group prefix. If a (exact, case sensitive) group
prefix, or a full test name is provided as the first argument, only that
group or test is run.

If a numeric second argument is provided, it will set the randomness
seed, for repeatable results from tests using randomness (currently none
of them).

This is mainly used by developers, but it's nice to be able to
sanity-check your installed hledger executable at any time. All tests
are expected to pass - if you ever see otherwise, something has gone
wrong, please report a bug!
